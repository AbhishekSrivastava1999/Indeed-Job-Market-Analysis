## 📌 Project Overview  
Over the past year, I have been actively searching for a **Data Analyst role in Canada**. To gain better insights into the job market, I decided to **analyze job postings from Indeed** and identify key trends such as:  

✅ **Top hiring cities & companies**  
✅ **Most in-demand job titles**  
✅ **Work mode distribution (On-site, Remote, Hybrid)**  
✅ **Job market trends & skill demand**  

This project helped me **develop my data storytelling and visualization skills** while providing a **real-world perspective on job market trends**.

## 📊 Key Insights  
📍 **Top Hiring Locations:** Toronto, Vancouver, and Mississauga have the highest job postings.  
📌 **Most Common Roles:** "Business Analyst" and "Data Analyst" are the most in-demand job titles.  
🏠 **Remote Jobs:** Only **~9.8%** of postings are remote, indicating a shift toward **on-site/hybrid roles**.
